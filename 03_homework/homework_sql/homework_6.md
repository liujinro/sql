**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

As a senior fund accountant, honestly, I did not have ethics and inequity components, specially for a financial area. Following ethics is the most important subject before starting the work. However, in daily life, there is the case I have expereinced about the ethics and inequity compents. Recently, we are increasingly called by liers. I thought it was not an important thing until I received a threten eamil from someone. In the email, he asked for $1000 USD for bit coin, or he threatened me to pulish all my personal life to the public. I cannot call police, or asking for my family, unless he would publish now. To be honest, I felt extreme scared and want to give him money as soon as possible. Luckliy, when I saw the for "porn videos", I know it was a fake email. However, I was thinking, who leak my email address? How the faker to send me message by my email? How we can protect ourselves from the case? It is very unfair if elder people or a teenager meet the same situation. How they can do? Or are they only be cheaked by the fake email? Who can protect us from the internet? Moreover, there are similar case happened in my previous company, more luckily, our company's IT systeram and IT reponsible person protect us, escially for the confendential information.
