**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

My Answer:

Reflecting on my tenure as a Senior Fund Accountant, ethics and equity were not always at the forefront of daily operations, yet they remain fundamental to any financial role. A personal experience that vividly highlighted the importance of these elements involved a cybersecurity incident that initially appeared as a direct threat to my personal safety and privacy.
I received a menacing email demanding $1000 in Bitcoin, with a threat to expose my personal information to the public. The email claimed to have private videos and threatened immediate exposure if I contacted the police or family for help. This was not only a direct attack on my privacy but also a moment of stark fear and vulnerability, which could have led to a rash decision to comply with the demand.
Upon closer examination, I realized the email was part of a phishing scam when I identified the videos mentioned as non-existent. This incident brought to light several ethical and equity issues. Firstly, the psychological manipulation used in such scams highlights a grave ethical breach that exploits individualsâ€™ fears. Secondly, it underscored how such threats could disproportionately affect those less technologically savvy or more vulnerable, such as older adults or younger individuals, potentially leading to unfair consequences.
This experience underscored the importance of robust cybersecurity measures within organizations to protect sensitive information from such unethical breaches. It also highlighted the need for ongoing education about digital security, not just for employees but also for clients and stakeholders, to ensure they are aware and equipped to handle such threats.
Reflecting on this, I see a clear need for incorporating stringent ethical standards and protective measures against data breaches in any financial role. Ensuring equity in how we protect all stakeholders, regardless of their digital proficiency, is also crucial. Moving forward, I would advocate for policies that enhance ethical practices and equitable treatment, promoting a safe and secure digital environment in the financial sector. This would involve not only technological safeguards but also fostering a culture of awareness and resilience against cyber threats.
